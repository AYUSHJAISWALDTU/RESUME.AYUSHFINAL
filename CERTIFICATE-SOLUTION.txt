- Professional and user-friendly

ðŸ”„ TO UPGRADE TO DIRECT DOWNLOADS:

STEP 1: Add Certificate Files
   â€¢ Save certificates as PDF files in:
     /Users/akjaiswal/Desktop/resume/assets/certificates/
   â€¢ Use these exact names:
     - dsa-mastermind.pdf
     - spark-iit.pdf  
     - code-for-bharat.pdf

   change the HTML links from mailto: to file paths.
